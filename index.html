                <h2>Point Pelee National Park</h2>
                <p>Point Pelee National Park is a national park in Essex County in southwestern Ontario, Canada where it extends into Lake Erie. The word pelée is French for 'bald'. Point Pelee consists of a peninsula of land, mainly of marsh and woodland habitats, that tapers to a sharp point as it extends into Lake Erie.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Aboriginal people lived on Point Pelee for many years before European colonization, dating back to at least 6,000 years.[2] The largest archaeological site found at Point Pelee is thought to have been occupied between AD 700 and 900.</p>

                <h2>Geography</h2>
                <p>Located in the western parts of the St. Lawrence Lowlands, the park is a sandspit formation that extends 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) into Lake Erie and is up to 70 metres (230 ft) thick.[10] With an area of only 1,564 hectares (3,860 acres), it is Canada's smallest national park.</p>

                <h2>Flora and fauna</h2>
                <p>Owing to its southernly location and the moderating effects of Lake Erie, the climate in the park is slightly warmer than the rest of Canada[10] and many Carolinian faunal species, which are rare in Canada are located here.[3] Examples include the fox snake and the five-lined skink.</p>

                <h2>Climate</h2>
                <p>Point Pelee has a humid continental climate (Dfa under the Köppen climate classification) with warm, humid summers, and cold winters that is modified by the surrounding waters of Lake Erie.[3] It lies in a zone that is characterized by variable weather due to conflict between polar and tropical air masses.</p>
